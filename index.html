          When boards went up and demolition began at the Lindemann House in November, some members of the community took notice, renewing Bushwick's discussion on landmarking.

        The mansion, built in 1890, is a part of a series of historic housing along Bushwick Ave. that have been studied since the early 1970s by the Landmarks Preservation Commission for landmarking and historic districting. Unlike neighboring
        districts in Brooklyn, Bushwick has no designated historic districts. Some say this is due to a lack in community interest.

        “Like many areas in New York City that are dealing with bigger issues, like housing and income disparity, landmarking has never been their priority,” said Kelly Carroll, director of advocacy and community outreach at the Historic Districts
        Council.

        "I feel like this mansion...it’s reawakened everyone," said Carroll. "The research is done, all that is required is the political will to make this happen."
